# Pathways Module 1: Setting up your Git repository

In your top-level README file, you should include the following:

- A short description of the project
- Instructions for running the code
- Contributing guidelines, in case others wish to contribute to your repository
- Acknowledgements for any assistance you received or attribution for the owners
  or creators of assets you used for your project such as the weather data
- The license notice that appears directly after this help section, unchanged.

It should not include any of this help text, however. Replace everything you see
in between the main heading and the license heading below.
